# ERROR408.exe
Safe recreation of Error408.exe prank virus. Simulates dramatic Windows errors and plays a bundled video (ree.mp4). Includes harmless config, DLLs, and debug files. Customize by swapping the video for your own finale. Not malware, purely theatrical chaos.
## HOW DO I PUT MY OWN MP4 VIDEO IN IT?
🔄 To customize the prank, just replace **ree.mp4** with your own video file. 
Make sure it’s named **ree.mp4** and placed in the same folder as ERROR408.exe.
If you replace a MP4 with the exact name but different video, it responds with that. 
It MUST be **ree.mp4**. Otherwise it doesn't work. Thanks for reading!
